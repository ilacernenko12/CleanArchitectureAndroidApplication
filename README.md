This project is a mobile application developed using cutting-edge technologies to fetch data from a server and present it to the user. The project adheres to the principles of clean architecture and leverages MVVM architecture, Flow for handling asynchronous data, Paging for efficient loading of large data sets, Jetpack Compose for creating the user interface, Hilt for dependency injection, and Retrofit 2 for server communication.

## Key Features

- Fetching data from a server and displaying it reactively using Flow.
- Implementing pagination for loading data as the user scrolls.
- Utilizing the MVVM pattern for managing business logic and data presentation.
- Creating the user interface with Jetpack Compose, providing a more flexible and declarative UI development approach.
- Dependency injection with Hilt for managing dependencies in the application.
- Interacting with a remote server through Retrofit 2.
